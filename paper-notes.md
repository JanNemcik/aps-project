# System performance evaluation using different virtuazlization techniques

## Environments

- containerization (Docker)
- full virtualization

  - software (VirtualBox)
  - hardware (KVM vs HYPER-V)

- para virtualization (Xen)

## What to do

- measure guest machine performance
- measure host machine impact due to VM
- advantages/disadvantages of usage

## Evaluation

- best virtualization -> high performance of guest machine / low impact on host machine
- differences between each virtualization
- best uses cases for each virtualization type

- 1 benchmarkovy problem
